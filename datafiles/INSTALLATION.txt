This requires you to know how to use a computer.

1. Copy the "sound" folder over from your Pizza Tower install
2. Copy the base game "data.win" file over too
3. Use DeltaPatcher to patch the "data.win" with the "data.xdelta"

If you encountered issues at any step in this guide, you are retarded.
Please don't talk to me. Thank you.
